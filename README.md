This project presents a four-way Adaptive Traffic Control System designed using Arduino, IR
sensors, counter ICs, and 7-segment displays. The system intelligently controls traffic
signals by detecting the presence and number of vehicles on each road. If fewer than three
vehicles are detected, the light does not switch to that road, reducing unnecessary waiting
time. The Arduino acts as the data collector and decision maker, controlling counter ICs that
drive 7-segment displays through a BCD-to-7-segment decoder. The design improves traffic
flow efficiency, minimizes fuel consumption, and ensures pedestrian and emergency safety.
